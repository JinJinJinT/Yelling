PLAN FOR THIS PROJECT: (at least it follows Twitter TOS now)

VERSION 1:

1. talk to twitter, make a new key, project, and shit
2. make a test tweet on popoff
3. get the id of that tweet
4. check for new tweets there
5. if a new tweet is made then take the text of that tweet and set it as text to synthesize
6. send to goggle txt2spch api and recieve and audio file
7. play the audio file on my computer

VERSION 2:

1. have AWS/Rasberyy PI host the entire process
2. Have the audio not play on my computer but an external speaker (maybe a wireless reciever/bluetooth?)

VERSION 3:

1. a website where people can input text (don't even wanna think abt the front end on that)
2. you can see all past requests
3. make it not hackable

REQS for a V3: 
1. make public server
2. I cry in front-end pain

Maybe have a Version 3-(psuedo)
1. I borrow some stuff from other things so I don't have to make the front and back-end on my own until I can
   figure that out.


---------------------

Variations:

ppl can make a servo/motor move or do something depending on certain commands from twitter or a website
